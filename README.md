## What is workflow?

**workflow** aims to be the playbook for aspiring software engineers. It's a curation of recommended practices and resources in everything from front-end design to cloud provisioningâ€”most of which can be hard to find. Each guide outlines helpful tips and tricks that any developer can quickly pull into their own workflows.
