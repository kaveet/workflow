## What is Workflow?

**Workflow** aims to be the playbook for aspiring software engineers. It's a curation of recommended practices and resources in everything from front-end design to cloud provisioningâ€”most of which can be hard to find. Each guide outlines helpful tips and tricks that any developer can quickly pull into their own workflows. One day, it might even turn into a book ;)

## Why Workflow?

According to a 2018 HackerRank survey, a staggering 74% of us are at least partially self-taught!<sup>[1](https://research.hackerrank.com/developer-skills/2018/)</sup> We've waded through pages of tutorials, watched hours of YouTube, and learned (a lot) from our failures. We've developed our own practices and found comfort in our individual styles.

**Workflow** is an effort to bring all these lessons together and pass on our collective knowledge to the next generation of developers. 

Inspiration for **Workflow** includes:

* [Developer Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap)
* [ThoughBot Playbook](http://thoughtbot.com/playbook)
* And many more!
